Then I started university at [IST](http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) and my interests started shifting towards web development so I built a website with a [friend](http://twitter.com/raicuparta) which let anyone [play with robots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JoARkj7XMA) from around the world. That was on the first year and it was featured on sites like [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2013/03/pi-day-raspberry-pi-projects/#slide-424430) and the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/livebots/).
