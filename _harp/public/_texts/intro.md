## Hey there!

My name is [**Francisco Baio Dias**](/about), and I'm a full-stack developer at [Typeform](https://typeform.com), in **Barcelona** from the also sunny city of Lisbon, Portugal. I love [**open-source**](https://github.com/xicombd) and coding **Javascript**, mainly **React** and **Node.js**. I also enjoy [listening to music](https://open.spotify.com/user/1175418489/playlist/0P19ALwC0QB24n6CPXIokz) and [**traveling**](https://www.instagram.com/fbaiodias/).
