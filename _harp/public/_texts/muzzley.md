In the meanwhile I also started working for [Muzzley](https://www.muzzley.com/), an intelligent platform for IoT consumer world. It avoids the need to have tons of different apps to interact with all the different devices. When I started, I worked mainly on the integration of those devices, doing reverse engineering of the APIs when needed, and implementing their managers in Node. Then I was mainly focused on the API, but I've also worked on the website and core messaging platform.
